          <p>
            I love coding - I get so much satisfaction from coming up with
            working solutions, solving real problems and automating tasks so
            that my time may be better spent elsewhere.
            <br /><br />
            Another reason I am so drawn to coding is because it and tech
            intersect with and are required in nearly every other field,
            including my other main passion: animals!
            <br /><br />
            I grew up in a homeschooling community in the Texas wilderness where
            I developed a very deep love and appreciation for animals. Much of
            my motivation comes from the desire to help protect them in whatever
            way I can.
            <br />
            <img
              alt="Lily as a child laying on a blanket with baby quails."
              src="src/graphics/little_lily.jpg"
            />
            <br />
            That's why, in 5th grade when I realized how far I had fell behind
            my peers academically, I asked my mother if we could move to Austin
            so that I could attend a public school. Thankfully, she agreed.
            <br /><br />
            My most proud accomplishment is going from receiving the exact math
            standardized test score I needed to advance into 6th grade and being
            placed in remedial classes to graduating at the top of my class in
            high school and receiving the highest score possible in the AP
            calculus exam. The transition and reframing the way I thought about
            learning and approached school was extremely grueling at times.
            <br /><br />
            However, that process allowed me to hone skills that benefit me
            every day:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>I am extremely detail-oriented.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I have grit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I am a self-starter and quick learner.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy drawing, creating and modifying clothing or
            thrifted items, song-writing, working on personal projects, video
            games, and hanging out with my cat.
